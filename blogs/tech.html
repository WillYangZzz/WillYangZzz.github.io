        <header>The realtionship between JavaScript and html/css</header>
        <p>
          We use html to make the structure of a website, css to make the
          website looks good, and javascript to make the website work.

        <header>Control flow and Loops</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Control flow means the order in which the computer executes
            statements in a script. For example:
          </p>
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
          <p>
            The computer will excute the first line and then the second line of
            this code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Loops means when you want to repeat some actions, and you can use a
            loop to do that. For example, while you are in a party, you can keep
            drinking and playing video game, but when the party is over, you
            need to sotp these activities. Like in this code:
          </p>
          <code>
            for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {console.log("Walking east one
            step"); }
          </code>

          In this for loop, it will run 5 times with values of step 0 through 4,
          and print "Walking east one step" 5 times.

        <header>DOM</header>

        <article>
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
            document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
            document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
            interact with the page.
          </p>

          <code>
            const spans = document.querySelectorAll('.dom') for (let i = 0; i <
            spans.length; i++) { spans[i].innerHTML = 'HTML5 Document Object
            Model' }
          </code>

          In this one, we use document.querySelectorAll('.dom') to get all the
          'dom' class in html, and change the text to 'HTML5 Document Object
          Model.'

        <header>Accessing data from arrays and objects</header>

        <article>
          <p>
            Arrays means a list, like let arry = ["a", "b", "c"]. In this
            example, if you want to get b, you can use arry[1]. There are
            <a
              href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-access-array-of-objects-in-javascript/"
              >several ways</a
            >
            to access data from arrys:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Using the [ ] notation</li>
            <code>arrayName[arrayIndex]</code>
            <li>Using DOT notation</li>
            <code>arrayName[arrayIndex].propertyName</code>
            <li>Using for..in loop</li>
            <code
              >console.log("Accessing the values using the for..in loop:") for
              (var key in objArr) { // Console logs all the values in the objArr
              Array: console.log(objArr[key]); }</code
            >
            <li>Using forEach Loop</li>
            <code
              >arrayName.forEach(function(item) { console.log(item); });</code
            >
            <li>Using map() method</li>
            <code>arrayName.map((item) => { console.log(item); });</code>
            <li>Using filter() method</li>
            <code>arrayName.filter(function(item) { console.log(item); })</code>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object"
              >Objects</a
            >
            usually means a collection of different properties. For exampole, a
            car object has properties like weight, color, name, and model.
            <code>const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};</code>
            There are three ways to access the properties of an object.
            <ul>
              <li>Dot property accessor: object.property</li>
              <code>const hero = {
                name: 'Batman'
              };
              
              // Dot property accessor
              console.log(hero.name); // => 'Batman'</code>
              <li>Square brackets property accessor: object['property']</li>
              <code>const property = 'name';
                const hero = {
                  name: 'Batman'
                };
                
                // Square brackets property accessor:
                console.log(hero['name']);   // => 'Batman'
                console.log(hero[property]); // => 'Batman'</code>
              <li>Object destructuring: const { property } = object</li>
              <code>const hero = {
                name: 'Batman'
              };
              
              // Object destructuring:
              const { name } = hero;
              console.log(name); // => 'Batman'</code>
            </ul>

        <header> What's the problem </header>
        <p>When I did the kata challenge, I stuck in the Gradebook challenge.</p>
        <code>
          // 4. Complete the addScore function that has two parameters: studentName, and score.
          // addScore should add the score which is passed to it to the given studentâ€™s testScores array.
          // For example:
          // addScore("Susan", 80)  would push the score 80 into the value of gradebook.Susan.testScores
          
          function addScore(studentName, score) {
            gradebook[studentName].testScores.push(score)
          }</code>
          <header>How did I slove the problem</header>
          <p>Firstly, I check the test document, read the error messages and check out which part I failed. Then I used console.log to check every step of the code, and I found where the problem is. During the process I used google a lot, trying to find answers throught the Internet. I also ask quesions on #tech-questions channel</p>
          <code>I learned that when facing a coding issue, I should let myself calm down first. Then look the instructions word by word carefully. Many times I made mistakes becasue I didn't read the question carefully and miss some details. I should also check my codeing line by line, and make sure I understand the output of each coding.</code>
          <header>Reflections about problem-solving techniques</header>
          <p>When I face a problem, the first thing I would use is to check error messages. Then change my code and console.log the result. If still not working, I would use google to search if anyone has similar problem and answers. If still not working, I would go to tech channel to ask help. I find reading document and error message is still challenging for me, as I always miss some details. I should really calm myself down and read carefully.</p>
          <header>Reflect a time I were reluctant to ask for help</header>
          <p>When I faced a problem in kata challenge 4, I didn't want to ask help in tech channel. Maybe I felt my quesion is a easy one, and I didn't want to look dump in other people's eyes. Instead, I used other techniques to solve this problem, but it cost me a long time. Next time, if I stuck in a problem for over 30 mins, I would just go to tech channel and get some help from our wonerful group.</p>
