        <header>Emotional Intelligence</header>
        <p>Cultivating emotional intelligence is one way of helping us in this complex world, helping us as we study at Dev Academy, and helping us work in the wider world. There are three steps to practice EQ</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Mindfulness</li>
          <code>
            Mindfulness practice is helpful in all aspects of life. It leads us to better understand and relate to ourselves and the world. Regular mindfulness practice improves attention. It can also cultivate a greater sense of compassion for ourselves and others. The practice of mindfulness can teach us to be less reactive. This helps us make wiser choices when faced with challenging situations.
          </code>
      
          <li>Self knowledge and Mastery</li>
          <code>We can see what's going on for us internally with an attentive mind. We grow more knowledge of who we are, how we are and how we engage in any particular situation. From knowledge comes mastery, e.g. "Oh, I know what happens when I get angry. I know the intensity of it and how to regulate it."</code>
          <li>Creating Useful Mental Habits</li>
          <code>What would it be like if every time I walked into a room of people I don't know, my immediate mental habit was, "Oh, I wish everyone well in this room"? We can train our minds to develop habits to defend against the superego (the critical, judging mind).</code>
        </ol>
      
        <header>How do we Cultivate Emotional Intelligence?</header>
        <p>We can train our brain to improve our EQ. There are three ways I can exercise every day</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Mindfulness practice</li>
          <code>Mindfulness helps us cultivate focus and attention. This is a valuable asset to have during the challenges we set at Dev Academy. But mindfulness can also help us pay better attention to what's going on inside. This awareness can help us take better care of ourselves as we embark on this difficult journey. The key aspect of being attentive to our experience is to do so non-judgmentally. That is to simply notice what you are experiencing, without criticisms, judgments, or evaluations. Just notice.</code>
          <li>Conscious listening</li>
          <code>Rather than pay attention to the breath as we do in mindfulness, we pay attention to what someone else is saying. </code>
          <li>Journaling</li>
          <code>We use reflections in place of journaling during foundations, as the two service a similar function. As your learning journey continues through Bootcamp, we'll introduce journaling as basically a brain dump. So you start writing for a prompt, and you don't stop.
           What I'm feeling right now is ...
           When I feel understood I ...
           What I care about is ...

        <header>The realtionship between JavaScript and html/css</header>
        <p>
          We use html to make the structure of a website, css to make the
          website looks good, and javascript to make the website work.
        </p>
    
        <header>Control flow and Loops</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Control flow means the order in which the computer executes
            statements in a script. For example:
          </p>
          <code
            >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
            greetMe("World");
          </code>
          <p>
            The computer will excute the first line and then the second line of
            this code.
          </p>

          <p>
            Loops means when you want to repeat some actions, and you can use a
            loop to do that. For example, while you are in a party, you can keep
            drinking and playing video game, but when the party is over, you
            need to sotp these activities. Like in this code:
          </p>
          <code>
            for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {console.log("Walking east one
            step"); }
          </code>

          In this for loop, it will run 5 times with values of step 0 through 4,
          and print "Walking east one step" 5 times.

        <header>DOM</header>

        <article>
          <p>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web
            documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the
            document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the
            document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can
            interact with the page.
          </p>

          <code>
            const spans = document.querySelectorAll('.dom') for (let i = 0; i <
            spans.length; i++) { spans[i].innerHTML = 'HTML5 Document Object
            Model' }
          </code>

          In this one, we use document.querySelectorAll('.dom') to get all the
          'dom' class in html, and change the text to 'HTML5 Document Object
          Model.'

        <header>Accessing data from arrays and objects</header>

        <article>
          <p>
            Arrays means a list, like let arry = ["a", "b", "c"]. In this
            example, if you want to get b, you can use arry[1]. There are
            <a
              href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-access-array-of-objects-in-javascript/"
              >several ways</a
            >
            to access data from arrys:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Using the [ ] notation</li>
            <code>arrayName[arrayIndex]</code>
            <li>Using DOT notation</li>
            <code>arrayName[arrayIndex].propertyName</code>
            <li>Using for..in loop</li>
            <code
              >console.log("Accessing the values using the for..in loop:") for
              (var key in objArr) { // Console logs all the values in the objArr
              Array: console.log(objArr[key]); }</code
            >
            <li>Using forEach Loop</li>
            <code
              >arrayName.forEach(function(item) { console.log(item); });</code
            >
            <li>Using map() method</li>
            <code>arrayName.map((item) => { console.log(item); });</code>
            <li>Using filter() method</li>
            <code>arrayName.filter(function(item) { console.log(item); })</code>
          </ul>

          <p>
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object"
              >Objects</a
            >
            usually means a collection of different properties. For exampole, a
            car object has properties like weight, color, name, and model.
            <code>const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};</code>
            There are three ways to access the properties of an object.
            <ul>
              <li>Dot property accessor: object.property</li>
              <code>const hero = {
                name: 'Batman'
              };
              
              // Dot property accessor
              console.log(hero.name); // => 'Batman'</code>
              <li>Square brackets property accessor: object['property']</li>
              <code>const property = 'name';
                const hero = {
                  name: 'Batman'
                };
                
                // Square brackets property accessor:
                console.log(hero['name']);   // => 'Batman'
                console.log(hero[property]); // => 'Batman'</code>
              <li>Object destructuring: const { property } = object</li>
              <code>const hero = {
                name: 'Batman'
              };
              
              // Object destructuring:
              const { name } = hero;
              console.log(name); // => 'Batman'</code>
            </ul>
