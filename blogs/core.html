        <p>
          Cultivating emotional intelligence is one way of helping us in this
          complex world, helping us as we study at Dev Academy, and helping us
          work in the wider world. There are three steps to practice EQ
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Mindfulness</li>
          <code>
            Mindfulness practice is helpful in all aspects of life. It leads us
            to better understand and relate to ourselves and the world. Regular
            mindfulness practice improves attention. It can also cultivate a
            greater sense of compassion for ourselves and others. The practice
            of mindfulness can teach us to be less reactive. This helps us make
            wiser choices when faced with challenging situations.

          <li>Self knowledge and Mastery</li>
          <code
            >We can see what's going on for us internally with an attentive
            mind. We grow more knowledge of who we are, how we are and how we
            engage in any particular situation. From knowledge comes mastery,
            e.g. "Oh, I know what happens when I get angry. I know the intensity
            of it and how to regulate it."</code

          <li>Creating Useful Mental Habits</li>
          <code
            >What would it be like if every time I walked into a room of people
            I don't know, my immediate mental habit was, "Oh, I wish everyone
            well in this room"? We can train our minds to develop habits to
            defend against the superego (the critical, judging mind).</code

        <header>How do we Cultivate Emotional Intelligence?</header>
        <p>
          We can train our brain to improve our EQ. There are three ways I can
          exercise every day
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Mindfulness practice</li>
          <code
            >Mindfulness helps us cultivate focus and attention. This is a
            valuable asset to have during the challenges we set at Dev Academy.
            But mindfulness can also help us pay better attention to what's
            going on inside. This awareness can help us take better care of
            ourselves as we embark on this difficult journey. The key aspect of
            being attentive to our experience is to do so non-judgmentally. That
            is to simply notice what you are experiencing, without criticisms,
            judgments, or evaluations. Just notice.</code
          >
          <li>Conscious listening</li>
          <code
            >Rather than pay attention to the breath as we do in mindfulness, we
            pay attention to what someone else is saying.
          </code>
          <li>Journaling</li>
          <code
            >We use reflections in place of journaling during foundations, as
            the two service a similar function. As your learning journey
            continues through Bootcamp, we'll introduce journaling as basically
            a brain dump. So you start writing for a prompt, and you don't stop.
            What I'm feeling right now is ... When I feel understood I ... What
            I care about is ...

        <p>
          For me, neuroplasticity means that my brain is not hard-wired and
          unchangeable. On the contrary, it is extremely resilient and is the
          process by which all permanent learning takes place in your brain,
          such as playing a musical instrument or mastering a different
          language. There are a few tips for this:
        </p>
        <code
          >Practice, practice, practice. Repeating an activity, retrieving a
          memory, and reviewing the material in various ways helps build
          thicker, stronger, more hard-wired connections in the brain.</code
        >
        <code>
          Put information in context. Recognising that learning is the formation
          of new or stronger neural connections makes sense to prioritise
          activities that help students tap into already-existing pathways (for
          instance, by integrating academic subjects or creating class projects
          relevant to their lives). In other words, nix the rote memorization.
          "Whenever new material is presented in such a way that students see
          relationships" between concepts, writes Willis, "they generate greater
          brain cell activity and achieve more successful long-term memory
          storage and retrieval."</code
        >
        <code
          >Let students know that this is how the brain works. Breaking through
          those neuro-mythological barriers that paint intelligence as
          predetermined may ease students' minds and encourage them to use their
          brains. Willis notes, "Especially for students who believe they are
          'not smart,' the realization that they can change their brains through
          study and review is empowering."</code

        <header>Growth mindset</header>
        <p>
          For me, growth minset means that talents and abilities can be
          developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. he view you
          adopt for yourself profoundly affects the way you lead your life. It
          can determine whether you become the person you want to be and whether
          you accomplish the things you value. The passion for stretching
          yourself and sticking to it, even (or especially) when itâ€™s not going
          well, is the hallmark of the growth mindset. This is the mindset that
          allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in
          their lives. There are several tips for growth mindset
        </p>
        <code
          >1. Believe in yourself, and believe that you can change with enough
          practice and exercise</code
        >
        <code
          >2. Keep practicing. The key of growing is that keep exercising and
          keep using the new knowledge. So everyday, I should set a small goal,
          such as finish some coding task. With this ongoing trying, sooner or
          later, I will master a code language.</code
